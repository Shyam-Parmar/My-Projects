# COVID-19
## Data Exploration
Utilizing SQL Server to perform data analysis on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This data was downloaded on 07/20/2021 from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths whereby it was the latest data at that time. The date the analysis was performed was between dates 07/21/2021 and 07/22/2021. 

The analysis is done to get insights of the virus, understand the number of cases, deaths, vaccines and percentages using the population for the country, and continents with time. I have used a variety of different SQL Query methods, such as Join Statements, various functions and formulas, CTE, Temp Tables and Views to aid in performing the analysis.
